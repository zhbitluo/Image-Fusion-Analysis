% Sharpness estimation using gradients
% This is the most simple and basic measure of sharpness. Although many
% great other techniques exist, even this primitive estimation algorithm
% finds itself decent practical usage.
% The file reads an image and iteratively smooths it more and more to
% present how sharpness reduces.
% The method is tested against mean and unsharp (sharpen) filtering.
%
% Usage: Just execute this file. (Remember to have lena.jpg next to this
% file)
% All results will be printed to matlab console.
